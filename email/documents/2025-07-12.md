- Problem to solve
    - Create a new email to `Email` table
    - Send back to frontend a response about result of sending email

- Input
    - request.user = "abc@gmail.com"
    - request.url = "emails/"
    - request.method = "POST"
    - request.body = emailData = "{recipients: ['a', 'b', 'c'], subject: 'Hello, body: 'Hello!'}"

- Action flow
    - Find `path('emails/', views.new_email, name=new_email)`
    - Process view `new_email(request)`
        - Verify that request.user logs in
            - If not yet, return `JsonResponse({'error': 'You not yet log in.'}, status=401)`
            - If logged in, process request
        - Process request
            - If request.method != 'POST'
                return `JsonResponse({'error': 'POST request required.', status = 405})`
            - If request.method == 'POST'
                - Get rawEmailPayLoad = request.body
                - Convert rawEmailPayLoad from string to JSON object: emailPayLoad = rawEmailPayLoad.json()
                - Get detailed email contents which are user input
                    - recipients = emailPayLoad['recipients']
                    - subject = emailPayLoad['subject']
                    - body = emailPayLoad['body']
                - Verify user input
                    - If not recipients or not subject or not body, return `JsonResponse({'error': 'Don't leave empty fields.'}, status=400)`
                    - If isinstance(recipients, str)
                        - recipientsList = recipients.split(',')
                        - recipientsList = [ email.strip() for email in recipientsList if email.strip()]
                    - If not isinstance(recipients, str)
                        - recipientsList = [email.strip() for email in recipientsList if email.strip()]
                        - recipientObjects = []
                    - Get recipientObjects = []
                        - for recipientEmail in recipientsList:
                            try
                                recipientObject = User.objects.get(username=recipientEmail)
                                recipientObjects.append(recipientObject)
                            exept User.DoesNotExist:
                                `JsonResponse({'error': f"'User with email {recipientEmail} do not exist."})`
                    - subject.strip()
                    - body.strip()
                - Create a instance of class `Email` without recipents because of `ManyToMany`
                    - newEmail = Email(user = request.user, sender = request.user, subject = subject, body = body)
                    - newEmail.save()
                - Add `recipientObjects` to newEmail.recipients
                - Return `JsonResponse({'message': 'Email sent successfully.', status = 201})`

- Output

    `JsonResponse({'message': '<message content>', status = <HTTP status>})`

<summary>Learning notes</summary>

- `!response.ok`

    We should check `!response.ok` before calling `response.json()` to clearly distinguish HTTP errors and successful reponses

- `Data format returned by backend (e.g.JSON, HTML, ...)`

    We should consider that data format returned by backend (e.g.JSON, HTML, ...) to ensure it is processed correctly on frontend

- `ManyToManyField` on Django Model

    Assume that you create an `Email` model which includes a `recipients` field. This field is defined as a `ManyToManyField` to `User` model. In the database, the `Email` table doesn't include `recipient` column. Instead, Django creates additional intermidiate table with columns like `id||email_id||user_id` to store `recipients` relationships.

    This is similar how we use raw SQL to create 3 tables: `user`, `email`, `email_recipients`.

- `User.objects.get(username=email)`

    We should use `.objects.get()` in `try/except` to handle error

    If user `if not User.objects.get(username=email)`, before the `if` statement is executed, `User.objects.get(username=email)` raises error if have error
