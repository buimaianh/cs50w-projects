<summary>2. Learning Notes</summary>

- `a front-end for an email client`

    Not static UI. It means dynamic UI:

    Dynamic UI refers to a user interface that can change or update its content and structure in response to user interactions or data changes, without requiring a full page reload. It often relies on client-side technologies such as JavaScript, AJAX, or frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular to update the UI dynamically and provide a smoother, more interactive user experience.

- `they won’t actually be sent to real email servers`

    Emails will not be sent to actual servers of email services (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook...) which are used to send and receive emails over the Internet.

- `credentials need not be valid credentials for actual email addresses`

    Don't need use actual email address and password

- `Note that if the email doesn’t exist, or <u>if the user does not have access to the email</u>, the route instead return a 404 Not Found error with a JSON response of {"error": "Email not found."}`

    - What does it mean?

        Need to check if the user has permission to access the mail before return it to them

    - Why do we need to double check the issue while after the user logs in, they can see only sent and recieved emails?

        - Never trust user input
            - The user can fix URL like `emails/123` while id `123` is not owned by them
            - Development error by dev/QA makes Security vulnerability

    - New knowledge about security

        - Should use `404` (Not found error - means the email not exist) than `403` (Forbiden - the email existed but the user is not owner -> hacker still can try to find way to access the email)
        - Cache bugs
            - A person logs in -> email `123` is saved to cache
            - A person logs out, B person logs in -> cache still saves `123`
            - B person reload the page -> frontend sends `GET /emails/123/` to backend
